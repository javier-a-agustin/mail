## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `python manage.py makemigrations`

Responsible for creating new migrations based on the changes you have made to your models. 
If you run the project for the first time, first run this script.

### `python manage.py migrate`

Responsible for applying and not applying migrations.
If there is no database (SQlite), one will be created with all migrations.
If you run the project for the first time, run this script after running `python manage.py makemigrations`

For others databases engines look at [databases](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/databases/)
